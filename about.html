                    <p>
                        LET’S BE FRIEND network has been making a positive impact since its inception on 7th April 2020.
                        Due to social security issues, the network officially started running projects on 10th September 2022.
                        In 2022, our team successfully planned, organized, and executed various projects, receiving insightful feedback.
                        Some of the notable programs in 2022 include:
                    </p>

                        <li>CHARMAGHZ LIBRARY</li>
                        <li>EMAL Asefi Orphanage</li>

                        <li>Better values consultancy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In 2023, we continued our efforts, designing, organizing, and producing a campaign named "A CHILD A FUTURE" in four rounds.
                        The first round covered the requirements of 50 postudents to maintain school materials.
                        The second round was "A CHILD A Smile," featuring charismatic people and celebrities having photos with children to make them happy and motivated.
                        The third round, in partnership with the CHARMAGHZ organization, focused on the distribution of books for Afghan Street Children in three weeks.
                        In the fourth round, the team distributed 25 Street Children's clothes, books, and cash as gifts.

                        The LET'S BE FRIEND network is looking and working for a global organization and rational regime that makes the world a better and peaceful place for children and a new generation.
                        A capacity-building seminar for 60 girls during the three days.
                        The Power of Motivation seminar for 250 youths in two months.

                        In 2023, the Let's be friend team got motivated, inspired, and attractive with more experience to make an acknowledged society and a better generation.
                        So, they designed, organized, and produced a campaign by the name of "A CHILD A FUTURE" in four rounds.
                        The first round of the campaign started and covered 50 postudents’ requirements to maintain school materials.
                        The second round was "A CHILD A Smile". In this round, charismatic people and celebrities had a photoshoot with children that made them happy and motivated.

                        The third was in partnership with the CHARMAGHZ organization. This round was the distribution of books for Afghan Street Children in three weeks.

                        In the fourth round, the team distributed 25 Street Children's clothes, books, and cash as gifts.
